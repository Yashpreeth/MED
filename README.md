 Computer Science Engineering a field of engineering which studies various aspects of
computer technology and its applications for designing innovative ideas with pragmatic
behavior in order to make the task of complexities easier than earlier. Computer Science
Engineering will provide knowledge of design, implementation and management of
information system of both hardware and software. The objective of our work/project is to
study various branches of Computer Science Engineering and review them practically as well
as theoretically to gain ability to implement any one of its branch uses experimentally with a
design which can evaluate the complex scenarios of daily life. As part of our work various
branches of CSE are studied and analyzed from which we can gain ability to design a
paradigm from any one of the subjects studied. Our projectâ€™s objective is understood the
concepts and need of computer programming and security. Here various algorithms like RC5,
Blowfish, RSA, AES, DES etc are compared and implemented using programming languages
like Java and C. Finally the RC5 algorithm is opted to develop a security application which
can share the information, protect the information and its confidentiality using symmetric
encryption keys.
